There are a few documents here that are intended for those who want to try trunk as it is being developed. There is also an [issues tracker](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/issues) that is here to accept bug reports from the community in a consolidated space, and eventually I will start adding documentation to the wiki.

## Obsidian Repository

This repository is also an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) repository. You can import it as a vault and work with it locally. Editing is just a pull request.
