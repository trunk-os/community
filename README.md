There are a few documents here that are intended for those who want to try trunk as it is being developed. There is also an [discussion board](https://github.com/trunk-os/community/discussions) for discussing issues and feature requests. I want to focus the repository issue trackers and this is a way to accept bug reports from the community in a consolidated space. Some documentation exists already and we'll establish a process to allow contributions.

## Obsidian Repository

This repository is also an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) repository. You can import it as a vault and work with it locally. Editing is just a pull request.
